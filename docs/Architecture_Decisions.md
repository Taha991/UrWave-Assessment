# Architecture and Design Decisions

## Why Onion Architecture Over 3-Tier Architecture?

### Advantages of Onion Architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Onion Architecture enforces a clear separation of responsibilities across layers.
   - It ensures that the core business logic is isolated from external dependencies like UI, databases, and frameworks.

2. **Testability**:
   - The core domain layer is independent and free from framework dependencies, making it easier to write unit tests for business logic.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Onion Architecture allows for swapping out external layers (e.g., databases or UI frameworks) without affecting the core logic.
   - It supports easy integration with modern technologies and tools.

4. **Maintainability**:
   - The structure of Onion Architecture simplifies code maintenance and evolution over time.
   - Clear boundaries reduce the risk of cross-layer dependencies that can lead to "spaghetti code."

### Why Not 3-Tier Architecture?

1. **Tight Coupling**:
   - 3-tier architecture often leads to tightly coupled layers, making it challenging to replace or modify individual components.

2. **Rigid Design**:
   - The dependency direction is fixed, typically from top to bottom. Onion Architecture, on the other hand, promotes a more flexible design.

3. **Modern Development Requirements**:
   - With microservices and modern cloud environments, the adaptability of Onion Architecture is more suited to evolving requirements than the traditional 3-tier approach.

## Why JWT for Authentication?

### Advantages of JWT (JSON Web Token):

1. **Stateless Authentication**:
   - JWTs enable stateless authentication, removing the need to store session data on the server.
   - This is ideal for distributed systems or cloud-based applications like ours.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Stateless authentication simplifies horizontal scaling as no session state is shared between servers.

3. **Compact and Efficient**:
   - JWTs are compact and can be efficiently transmitted between parties as part of HTTP headers.

4. **Cross-Domain Support**:
   - JWTs are self-contained and can be securely used across domains, making them ideal for APIs.

5. **Role-Based Access**:
   - JWT payloads can include role information, allowing for seamless implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## Why Repository Pattern?

### Advantages of Repository Pattern:

1. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstracts the data access layer, reducing the dependency on specific ORMs or database technologies.

2. **Testability**:
   - Enables mocking or stubbing of the data layer for easier unit testing.

3. **Centralized Data Access Logic**:
   - All data access logic is centralized, ensuring consistency across the application.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Simplifies the process of switching or supporting multiple database types in the future.

## Why Minimal API Over FastEndpoints?

### Advantages of Minimal API:

1. **Simplicity**:
   - Minimal APIs provide a lightweight, straightforward way to build APIs without the overhead of controllers and unnecessary abstractions.

2. **Performance**:
   - Minimal APIs are optimized for high performance, making them ideal for modern web applications.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Developers have more control over how requests and responses are handled, without being constrained by predefined conventions.

4. **Rapid Development**:
   - Minimal APIs reduce boilerplate code, allowing for faster development cycles and easier onboarding for new team members.

5. **Alignment with Modern Practices**:
   - Amazon and other industry leaders emphasize clean, efficient solutions. Minimal APIs align with this approach, enabling professional-grade implementations without unnecessary complexity.

### Why Not FastEndpoints?

1. **Steeper Learning Curve**:
   - FastEndpoints introduces additional abstractions that may increase the learning curve for new developers.

2. **Overhead**:
   - For smaller or mid-sized applications, the additional structure provided by FastEndpoints may be unnecessary.

3. **Flexibility Limitations**:
   - Minimal APIs provide more control over request and response pipelines compared to FastEndpoints.

## Conclusion

- **Onion Architecture**: Provides better separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability compared to 3-tier.
- **JWT Authentication**: Enables stateless, scalable, and efficient authentication with support for role-based access.
- **Repository Pattern**: Offers abstraction, testability, and centralized data access logic, essential for robust systems.
- **Minimal API**: Chosen for its simplicity, performance, and alignment with professional development practices like those used at Amazon.
